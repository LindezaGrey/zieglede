This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to choose your preferred
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

```
sudo apt-get install gcc binutils bzip2 flex python perl make grep unzip gawk subversion libz-dev
```

Run

```
./scripts/feeds update -a
```

 to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and 
```
./scripts/feeds install -a
```
to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
